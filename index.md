<br/>Welcome to my personal website! I am currently a research assistant at the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), where I work under the supervision of Prof. [Min Yang](https://minyang.me/). Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Shandong University. My primary research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
